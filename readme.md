Tfolex is a command-line utility designed to extract and export your Telegram chat lists and the detailed structure of your chat folders into organized CSV or JSON files.

It's a perfect tool for archiving, analysis, or simply getting a comprehensive overview of your Telegram account's organization.

## Why Use Tfolex?

-   **Digital Archiving:** Create a backup of your folder structures and a master list of all chats you are a part of.
-   **Data Analysis:** Export your chat list to a spreadsheet to sort, filter, and analyze your communication patterns.
-   **Migration & Tooling:** Get a clean list of chat names and their corresponding IDs, which can be used for other scripts or bots.
-   **Account Cleanup:** Quickly identify old, archived, or unused chats, groups, and channels.

## Features

-   **Interactive CLI Menu:** Easy-to-use menu system for choosing operations.
-   **Master Chat List Extractor:**
    -   Fetch all chats from your account.
    -   Filter by type: Personal DMs, Groups, Channels, and Bots.
    -   Exports `Chat Name`, `Chat ID`, `Chat Type`, and `Archived Status`.
-   **Advanced Folder Extractor:**
    -   Extracts detailed information for selected (or all) chat folders.
    -   Lists pinned, included, and excluded chats within each folder.
    -   Shows the rules used to build the folder (e.g., include all channels, exclude muted, etc.).
-   **Flexible Export Options:** Save extracted data as:
    -   **CSV:** Ideal for use in spreadsheets like LibreOffice Calc or Microsoft Excel.
    -   **JSON:** Best for developers, archiving, and programmatic use.
-   **Secure & Session-Based:** Handles 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) and creates a local session file for quick, subsequent logins without re-entering credentials.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Python 3.8+**
2.  **A Telegram Account**
3.  **Telegram API Credentials (API ID and Hash)**
    -   You must obtain these from Telegram. It's a simple, one-time process.
    -   Log in to [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) with your phone number.
    -   Go to "API development tools" and fill out the form (app name and short name can be anything, e.g., "Tfolex Utility").
    -   You will be given an `api_id` and `api_hash`. **Keep these secret!**

## Installation & Setup

**1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dragon-Elec/Tfolex.git
cd Tfolex
```

**2. Set up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**

This isolates the project's dependencies from your system.

*   On Linux/macOS:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
*   On Windows:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

**3. Install Dependencies**

The only external library needed is `telethon`.

```bash
pip install telethon
```

**4. Create the Configuration File**

Create a file named `config.ini` in the same directory as the script. Copy the contents below and fill in your details.

```ini
[telegram]
; Get these from my.telegram.org
api_id = 12345678
api_hash = your_long_api_hash_string_here
phone_number = +12345678900 ; Use your full number with country code

[settings]
; The script will create a session file with this name
session_name = my_telegram_session

; Default names for the output files (date will be appended)
default_master_list_output = master_chat_list
default_folder_output = folder_export
```

---

## How to Use

**1. Run the Script**

Make sure your virtual environment is activated, then run:

```bash
python3 "tfolextractA {stable}.py"
```

**2. First-Time Login**

The first time you run the script, `telethon` will need to authorize your session:
-   It will ask for the code sent to your Telegram app.
-   If you have 2FA enabled, it will ask for your password.

A `.session` file (e.g., `my_telegram_session.session`) will be created. On subsequent runs, you will be logged in automatically.

**3. Main Menu**

You will see the main menu:

```text
==================== MAIN MENU ====================
1. Master Chat List (Extract all chats by type)
2. Folder Information (Export specific folder data)
3. Exit
Enter your choice:
```

-   Choose `1` to extract a list of your chats. You'll be asked which chat types to include.
-   Choose `2` to extract data about your chat folders. You'll be asked to select which folders to export.
-   Choose `3` to exit the program.

**4. Export Format**

After extracting the data, you will be prompted to choose an export format:

```text
--- Export Data ---
  1. CSV (Recommended for spreadsheets like LibreOffice Calc)
  2. JSON (For developers & archiving)
Enter your choice (1 or 2):
```

The file will be saved in the same directory (e.g., `folder_export_2025-10-27.csv`).
